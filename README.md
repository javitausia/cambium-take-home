# Cambium Geospatial Data Developer Challenge

This repo answeres to the challenge proposed in [Geospatial Data Developer Take Home Challenge](https://github.com/cambium-earth/gdd-test).

It is divided in two main folders, each one designed to build to different docker containers:
- The first **postgres** container runs a PostgreSQL database.
- The second one, runs a Streamlit application that answers the main challenge questions.
